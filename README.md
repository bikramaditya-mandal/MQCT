# MQCT v20_21

## NOTE: 
Use this compilation script (./comp_MQCT [comp_MQCT]) since the directory name has changed in this version. Make changes in the PES script (./comp_PES) to compile your system's potential energy surface, and then link it (by making appropriate changes in the linking script ./link_ALL) to the MQCT object file.

**#** Several bugs are fixed in this version.
